Passerd
=======

What is _Passerd_?
------------------

_Passerd_ is a Twitter client that runs an IRC server. Just run it and point an
IRC client to it, and you'll see your Twitter friends as IRC contacts, and
tweets appearing as messages on an IRC channel.

Does it work?
-------------

It's currently on _alpha_ status, but it can already be used to fetch your home
timeline and submit new posts.

Sending/receiving Direct Messages, following/unfollowing/blocking people,
advanced list/search/notification support, and other features are planned.
