Passerd - A Twitter-IRC gateway
===============================

What is _Passerd_?
------------------

_Passerd_ is a Twitter client that runs an IRC server. Just run it and point an
IRC client to it, and you'll see your Twitter friends as IRC contacts, and
tweets appearing as messages on an IRC channel.

Does it work?
-------------

Yes! You can read posts from the people you follow, post new updates to
Twitter, and follow/unfollow people easily using just IRC commands.

See the `USERGUIDE` file for more information.
